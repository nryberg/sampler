The Coffee [Sales](samples.md#sales) data is a good example of accounting and sales data by time, value and location.  It can be joined to the [Travel](samples.md#travel) table to identify patterns where the drinker consumed caffeine in different locations.

It's sourced from ten years of transaction data, captured in a [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/) Budget, cleaned and simplified.

[Download](downloads.md) the data and take a shot at the [Challenges](challenges.md).
